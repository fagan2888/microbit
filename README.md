If you have a name badge from the 3rd Annual Man Global Systematic
Investment Symposium, you can run Python programs on it! It's really a
tiny computer called a [micro:bit](http://microbit.org/).

This repository contains an [example program](badge.py) and instructions to
help you get started.

Here at Man AHL, we use Python to build systematic trading strategies,
although we use slightly bigger computers.

## Getting Started

![laptop](laptop.jpg)

You will need:

* A computer
* Your micro:bit
* A micro USB cable

1. Connect the micro:bit to your laptop with the micro USB cable.

2. Open [the python editor](http://python.microbit.org/editor.html) in
   a web browser.
   
3. Copy
   [the example program here](badge.py) into
   the editor.
   
4. Click the download button, which looks like this:

5. Save the file to your micro:bit. Your micro:bit works just like a
   USB stick, so your computer should show your micro:bit as a
   directory to save to.
   
6. Your microbit will show a yellow flashing light whilst the program
   is loaded. Wait with baited breath.
   
7. You should now see your program running on the micro:bit!

### Next Steps

Try making changes to the program. Save the new version to your
micro:bit -- does it work?
