# microbit
Information about the BBC micro:bit that was included on the name badges at 3rd Annual Man Global Systematic Investment Symposium.

## Badge Application
The source code for the badges at the Symposium is in [badge.py](badge.py). You can use the information below to load it on to your micro:bit.

## Other examples
The other files in this repository contain micro:bit examples created at AHL. You can load them onto your micro:bit in the same way as the badge application, using the instructions below.

## Loading code on to your micro:bit
### Prerequisites
To load a program onto a micro:bit you will need:
* A micro:bit
* A computer running Windows, Mac OS or Linux
* A micro USB cable

### Steps
1. Connect the micro:bit to your computer using the USB cable. The micro:bit it will appear as a removable disc just like a USB pendrive would.
2. Open the file containing the program you want to load (e.g. [badge.py](badge.py)) in your web-browser by clicking a link from this page.
3. Select the entire contents of the file and copy it into your clipboard.
4. Go to [http://python.microbit.org/editor.html](http://python.microbit.org/editor.html)
5. Delete the example program from the code editor.
6. Paste in your program from your clipboard.
7. Click the "Download" button, a .hex file will be saved to your usual download location.
8. Find the downloaded file on your computer and copy it to the micro:bit
9. The yellow light on the back of the micro:bit will flash as the program is loaded
10. The program should now be running on the micro:bit

Alternatively, if you have your program's .py file on disc you can skips steps 3, 5 and 7 above and just drag the .py into the code editor to load it.

## Customising a micro:bit program
To make your own changes to an existing program follow the steps detailed above and make your changes using the online code editor between steps 6 and 7. 

## Creating your own micro:bit programs
To create your own programs from scratch open the online code editor at [http://python.microbit.org/editor.html](http://python.microbit.org/editor.html) and type in your own code. You can then follow steps 7-10 detailed above to load your program on to the micro:bit. You may find the resources listed below helpful.

## Links and Resources
* The [micro:bit site](http://microbit.org/) has lots of info about the device.
* Your micro:bit is programmed using a language called micropython, you can find the [documentation here](http://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io).
* micropython is a limited subset of the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) the same language used at AHL to code our trading strategies.
